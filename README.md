# Getting Started
In this project, we are going to have a simulation about face recognition.
The whole structure is divided into 4 parts:
* The general process of working with Yolo version 8
* Working online
* Working offline and preparing the dataset from scratch
* Results

## General process
### Installation
YOLOv8 released a package named “ultralytics”, that you can install with the mentioned command below.
```python
pip install ultralytics
```
### Preparation
By cloning the data, we can have the overall structure, we can prepare this item with the following command: (of course, we will tell another method for preparation in the last part)
```python
git clone https://github.com/SMSajadi99/Custom-Data-YOLOv8-Face-Detection.git
```
### Start Training
You can start training YOLOv8 on custom data by using mentioned command below in the terminal/(command prompt).
```python
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=custom.yaml epochs=3 imgsz=640
```
* `task` = detect (It can be segment or classify)

* `mode` = train (It can be predict or val)

* `model` = yolov8n.pt (It can yolov8s/yolov8l/yolov8x)

* `epochs` = 3 (It can be any number)

* `imgsz` = 640 (It can be 320, 416, etc, but make sure it needs to be a multiple of 32)

**Hint**: In the project that I implemented, I implemented it with yolov8s weight. I doubt you can change this weight according to the value of your GPU.
Wait for training to complete, and then do inference with newly created weights. Custom-trained weights will be saved in the folder path mentioned below.
```runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt```

### Start Test
Once your model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. Use the mentioned command below for detection with custom weights.
```python
yolo task=detect mode=predict model="runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt" source="test.png"

or

yolo task=detect mode=predict model="runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt" source="test.mp4"
```
## Working online
To work online, open this [code](https://github.com/SMSajadi99/Custom-Data-YOLOv8-Face-Detection/blob/main/Custom_Data_YOLOv8.ipynb) and execute it based on the first part.

## Working offline
To prepare the data, you must download the data from the following [site](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) and place it in a folder like the following structure:

```python
└── Dataset_Orginal
    ├── wider_face_split.zip
    ├── WIDER_test.zip
    ├── WIDER_train.zip
    └── WIDER_val.zip
```
Now `unzip` them and with this [code](https://github.com/SMSajadi99/Custom-Data-YOLOv8-Face-Detection/blob/main/Prapertion.py) that you have at your disposal, you can have the structure to start training. Run the following code:

```python
python Prapertion.py
```

### Folder structure:
After running the following code, the folder structure should be as follows: (It is clear that 3 folders train, valid and test are important.)
```python
.
└── Dataset_Orginal
    ├── test
    │   ├── images
    │   └── labels
    ├── train
    │   ├── images
    │   └── labels
    ├── valid
    │   ├── images
    │   └── labels
    |
    .
    .
    .
    |
```
Now create a folder called ‍‍`yolov8` and make the previous folders in the following format:
```
├── images
│   ├── test
│   ├── train
│   └── valid
├── labels
│   ├── train
│   └── valid
```
In the yolov8 folder, create a file named custom.yaml and set the following values in it: (Make sure to set the path according to your folder)
```python
path:  /<PATH-TO>/yolov8/
train: images/train
test: images/test
val: images/valid

#Classes
names:
 0: face
```

## Result
